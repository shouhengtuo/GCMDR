IMPLEMENT FOR graph convolution for predicting associations between miRNA and drug resistance using raw data


It should noted that, the aim of our codes is to predict the association between miRNA (the A column in ncDR excel file) and drug resistence (the combination of drug and disease; the B column in ncDR excel file).
